    <h3 class="pt-xl-0"> How we share Personal Information </h3>

    <section>
        <h4> Within our family of companies </h4>
        <p>
            In the normal course of performing Services for our clients, Personal Information may be shared within
            Gilead
            and its affiliates for research and statistical purposes, drug safety and efficacy purposes, disease
            management,
            system administration and crime prevention or detection, or any purpose otherwise identified in this Privacy
            Statement.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h4>With our Service Providers</h4>
        <p>We may retain other companies and individuals to perform Services on our behalf and we may collaborate with
            other companies and individuals with respect to particular products or Services. Examples of service
            providers include data analysis firms, credit card processing companies, customer service and support
            providers, e-mail and SMS vendors, web hosting and development companies and fulfillment companies. Providers
            also include our co-promote partners for products that we jointly develop and/or market with other
            companies. Some providers may collect Personal Information on our behalf.</p>
    </section>


    <section>
        <h4>In connection with Business Transactions</h4>
        <p>
            As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy assets. In such transactions, user information,
            including Personal Information, generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, if either Gilead
            itself or substantially all of Gilead assets were acquired, your Personal Information may be one of the
            transferred assets. Therefore, we may disclose and/or transfer your Personal Information to a third-party in
            these circumstances.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h4> To comply with our legal obligations </h4>
        <p>
            Gilead reserves the right to disclose, without your prior permission, any Personal Information about you or
            your use of the Services if Gilead has a good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) protect and
            defend the rights, property or safety of Gilead, our employees, other users of the Services, or the public;

            (b) enforce the terms and conditions that apply to use of the Services; (c) as required by a legally valid
            request from a competent governmental authority and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order; or
            legal process; or (d) respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties. We may also
            disclose Personal Information as we deem necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process,
            or governmental request.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <p>
            We may also disclose aggregate or de-identified data that is not personally identifiable to third parties
            for any purpose.

    <h3 class="pt-xl-0"> How does Gilead collect information online? </h3>
    <p>
        Gilead websites and apps may collect information that could be potentially personally identifiable about
        your visits without you actively submitting such information. Unidentified information may be collected
        using various technologies, such as cookies and web beacons. <a
                href="https://www.gilead.com/privacy-statements/cookie-statement" target="_blank">Cookies</a> are small
        text
        files that are transferred to your computer’s hard disk by a website. Web beacons (also referred to as GIF
        files, pixels, or internet tags) help Gilead understand how you navigate around Gilead websites. As part of
        your use of Gilead websites, your internet browser automatically transmits to Gilead websites some of this
        information, such as the URL of the website you just visited and the browser version your computer is operating.
        Passive information collection technologies can make your use of Gilead websites easier by allowing Gilead to
        provide better service, customize Gilead websites based on consumer preferences, compile statistics, analyze
        trends, and otherwise administer and improve Gilead websites. You can prevent the storage of cookies by
        adjusting the settings on your browser, though certain features of Gilead websites may not work without use of
        passive information collection technologies. Information collected by these technologies cannot be used to
        identify you without additional information.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some of Gilead’s business partners, with whom Gilead contracts to carry out the Services (e.g., website
        providers), may use their cookies on Gilead websites and apps. Although Gilead may not have direct access to
        or control over such cookies, this Privacy Statement governs the use of cookies by Gilead and such business
        partners on Gilead websites and apps. Gilead may also allow social media companies (e.g., Facebook) to put
        “widgets” on Gilead websites. These third-party tools may also be used to track you across websites. For
        example, so long as you are logged in to Facebook, every time you land on a webpage that has a Facebook
        widget, Facebook will know you are on that webpage. Gilead does not control the privacy practices of these
        third parties.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some internet browsers allow you to limit or disable the use of tracking technologies that collect
        unidentified information, such as a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) setting. Currently, we do not respond to DNT
        signals.

<article>
    <h3 class="pt-xl-0"> Special Programs and Clinical Trials </h3>
    <p> Gilead may offer apps, special programs, clinical trials, activities, events or promotions (“Programs”) that
        have unique or additional specific terms, privacy notices and/or consent forms that explain how any information
        you provide will be processed in connection with the Programs. Certain Programs may include options to help you
        afford your medications. Where required, we may provide additional terms. You should review the terms applicable
        to the Programs before interacting or participating in the Program. </p>

        Choice
    </h3>
    <p>
        Where Gilead relies on consent for the fair and lawful processing of Personal Information, the opportunity to
        consent will be provided prior to when the Personal Information in question is collected. Your consent may be
        given through your authorized representative such as a legal guardian, agent, or holder of a power of attorney.
        Where Gilead relies on consent, you will be entitled to withdraw that consent at any time.
    </p>

    <h3 class="pt-xl-0">
        International Data Transfers
    </h3>
    <p>
        Gilead maintains servers and other storage facilities in the United States, EU, and Asia. Gilead may transfer
        Personal Information outside of its country of origin for the purposes, and in the manner, set out in this
        Privacy Statement, including for processing and storage by service providers and affiliates in connection with
        such purposes. In all situations, Gilead takes reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy is protected. Such
        steps include, but are not limited to, implementing privacy, security, and contractual controls, as well as
        steps noted in this Privacy Statement, as required by applicable law.
    </p>
    <p>
        To the extent that any Personal Information is sent outside of an individual’s country, it is subject to the
        laws of the country in which it is held, and may be subject to disclosure to the governments, courts, or law
        enforcement or regulatory agencies of such other country, pursuant to the laws of such country, consistent with
        the Principles.
    </p>
    <p>
        Gilead endeavors to obtain assurances from its service providers and affiliates that they will safeguard
        Personal Information consistent with this Privacy Statement. An example of appropriate assurances that may be
        provided by service providers and affiliates includes a contractual obligation that they provide at least the
        same level of protection as is required by Gilead’s privacy principles set out in this Privacy Statement. Where
        Gilead has knowledge that a service provider or affiliate is using or disclosing Personal Information in a
        manner contrary to this Privacy Statement, Gilead will take appropriate steps to prevent or stop the use or
        disclosure.
    </p>
    <p>
        Gilead was a participant in the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks from 2017 to 2021. Gilead withdrew from Privacy Shield in May 2021. With respect to data transferred from the EU and Switzerland to the U.S., Gilead has and will continue to rely on appropriate data transfer safeguards, such as Standard Contractual Clauses, which remain in effect. 
    </p>
</article>

<article>
    <h3 class="pt-xl-0"> Security </h3>
    <p>
        Gilead has implemented reasonable physical, technical and managerial controls and safeguards to keep your
        Personal Information protected from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Such measures
        may include, but are not limited to: the encryption of communications via SSL, encryption of information while
        it is in storage, firewalls, access controls, separation of duties, and similar security protocols.
    </p>
    <p>
        Gilead trains its employees on the importance of privacy and how to handle and manage Personal Information
        appropriately and securely. Personal Information handled by agents, or companies with which Gilead may conduct
        joint programs, is governed by this Privacy Statement and the Principles.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please note, the confidentiality of Personal Information transmitted over the Internet cannot be guaranteed.
        Gilead urges you to exercise caution when transmitting Personal Information over the Internet. Gilead cannot
        absolutely guarantee that unauthorized third parties will not gain access to your Personal Information;
        therefore, when submitting Personal Information to Gilead online, you must weigh both the benefits and the
        risks.
    </p>

<article>
    <h3 class="pt-xl-0"> Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation </h3>
    <p>
        Gilead will use Personal Information only in ways that are compatible with the purposes for which it was
        collected, or consented to by the individual. Gilead will have appropriate steps in place to ensure that
        Personal Information is relevant to its intended use, accurate, complete, and current. Gilead will only store
        Personal Information for as long as it is needed to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, subject to
        applicable data retention periods imposed upon Gilead by applicable law. This may mean that your Personal
        Information is stored by Gilead for a number of years, depending on the purpose and need for that data to be
        processed. For more information about Gilead’s retention periods for Personal Information, please refer to the

        Your Rights
    </h3>
    <p>
        You may have certain rights and choices regarding our processing of your Personal Information. Depending on your
        jurisdiction, applicable law may entitle you to additional consumer rights, including the right to:
    </p>
    <ul>

        you are an authorized agent making a request on behalf of a consumer, we may require additional information to
        verify that you are authorized to make that request. This may include obtaining a written authorization and
        proof that you are authorized to make the request.

    <p>

    <p>
        Transfers of your Personal Information may be made to entities located outside the European Economic Area,
